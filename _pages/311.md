# One-Tap Hazard Reporting

Users in select cities can directly report hazards to their city's 311 line, including cars parked in the bike lane, potholes, close calls, near-misses, and more.

Our 311 reporting tool is designed to amplify your existing advocacy efforts by demonstrating the scale and scope of the problems your members face.

# Apply to be our next 311-enabled city
Bike/ped advocacy organizations can [apply](/311application) to be our next 311-enabled city.

If you are an individual, please reach out to your local bike/ped advocacy group and ask them to fill out the application. Individuals may also fill out our [interest form](/311requestform) to express their interest.


Applications will be rated on:
1. **Impact**. How much impact will our one-tap 311 reporting have on your advocacy?
2. **Scale**. How many riders will be submitting reports?
3. **Connectivity**. How will we connect with your city's 311 system? Is it likely that your city will "block" our 311 capability?
4. **Equity**. Will we be boosting already-known voices, or helping new voices be heard?

**Application Deadline: January 30th, 2024.**

# How we work
We won't enable 311 reporting in a city without the excitement of your local bike/ped advocacy group. Advocacy always starts locally. Our one-tap 311 reporting can boost existing advocacy efforts, but it can never replace what you do on the ground.

[Read about how our 311 reporting in Pittsburgh](https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/advocates-celebrate-city-funding-for-penn-avenue-bike-lane-upgrades-23023598) helped boost the advocacy efforts of BikePGH. After nearly a decade of their advocacy, riders in Pittsburgh flooded 311 with thousands of reports of cars parked in the bike lane. The data, combined with BikePGH's advocacy, made it impossible for the city to ignore bicyclists: concrete-protected bike lanes were finally installed.


# How to submit a report
When you encounter a hazard while riding, tap the screen to highlight the moment.
When you're safely at your destination, use our one-tap 311 reporting tool to automatically forward that hazard to decision makers in your city.
