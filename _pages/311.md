# 311 Reporting

Users in select cities can directly report hazards to their city's 311 line, including cars parked in the bike lane, potholes, close calls, near-misses, and more.

# Apply to be our next 311-enabled city
Bike/Ped advocacy organizations, local neighborhood groups, and other groups dedicated to bicyclist safety can [apply here](https://forms.gle/VFDqgsqmh9B7Acos6) to be our next 311-enabled city.
If you are an individual, get in touch with your local advocacy groups and ask them to fill out the application. Individuals may also fill out our [request form](https://forms.gle/HHFisHhgsHxaMvFi8), and if enough individuals in your city request it, we'll reach out to your local bike/ped advocacy group.

# How we work
We never enable 311 reporting in a city without the excitement of your local bike/ped advocacy group. Advocacy always starts locally. Our one-tap 311 reporting can boost existing advocacy efforts, but it can never replace what you do on the ground.

[Read about how our 311 reporting in Pittsburgh](https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/advocates-celebrate-city-funding-for-penn-avenue-bike-lane-upgrades-23023598) helped boost the advocacy efforts of BikePGH. After nearly a decade of their advocacy, riders in Pittsburgh flooded 311 with thousands of reports of cars parked in the bike lane. The data, combined with BikePGH's advocacy, made it impossible for the city to ignore bicyclists: concrete-protected bike lanes were finally installed.
