# Pittsburgh 311 Reporting

Users in Pittsburgh can directly report hazards to Pittsburgh 311, including cars parked in the bike lane, potholes, dangerous driving, and more.

With the app, you can send a 311 report with just three taps - we automatically populate all the other required information.

# Want this for your city?
Currently, this feature is only available in Pittsburgh. If you want your city to be next, fill out our [request form](https://forms.gle/HHFisHhgsHxaMvFi8).

# How to submit a 311 report in 3 Steps
It's much easier to report a hazard using our app than with any other 311 reporting system. Since we already have the date, time, location, and footage, all you need to do is select the report type.
