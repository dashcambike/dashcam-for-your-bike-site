# Our Story

We’re a Pittsburgh-based startup built by bike commuters who are tired of the inequities we face on city streets. We are tired of being forced into oncoming traffic by cars parked in the bike lane; we are tired of drivers passing within inches of us with no consequences.

Video evidence is not just useful for lawsuits (we hope you never get hit!). It’s useful to share your story with friends: the friend who doesn’t understand why you take the lane, or how scary it is when cars pass you at high speeds. It’s useful for public comment meetings, where residents don’t understand why you want a protected bike lane.

We want to live in a world where it doesn’t take bravery to ride on city streets.

# Mission Statement

Our mission is to make bicycling a safe, equitable, and enjoyable mode of transportation. Car ownership should not be a prerequisite to safe travel, and people on bicycles deserve to be treated with respect as equal users of our roads.
