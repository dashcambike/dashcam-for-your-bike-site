# The Best Phone Mounts for Dashcam for your Bike
Dashcam for your Bike is an iPhone App that makes recording footage on your bike easier.
With gesture-based controls so you don't have to take your eyes off the road, to screen-dimming to save you battery life, this app overcomes many of the issues people have with the normal camera app.

The app is compatible with any phone mount, but some are better than others.

The spherical connector  makes it easy to tilt up and down so you can look at your screen to check maps or Strava, then face it back outward to record.

The biggest issue we found is that on some road bikes and bumpy roads in portrait (vertical) mode, it can slip down and push on the volume-down button.
You can get around this by shooting in landscape (horizontally), but we found that we can avoid it slipping by just giving the sides an extra squeeze to tighten before we ride.

It is stable without the fourth strap, which blocks the camera - so we recommend not using the fourth strap to leave the camera clear (at your own risk - we're not making promises here!).
It can easily rotate to be horizontal and vertical, and installs quickly which makes it easy to move it between bikes.

It also works nicely on both road and mountain bike handlebars, whereas some of the other mounts are hard to position nicely on road bikes.
All mounts we tested work nicely on mountain bike handlebars.

# How to use the mounts

Before I had a PopSocket, I used the [All-Metal Mount](https://www.amazon.com/GUB-Motorcycle-Aluminum-Rotation-Adjustable/dp/B07GKT8FBZ/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=WExxg&pf_rd_p=8b894231-4b84-44da-9446-c27cf0e8abc2&pf_rd_r=7S1SWGQFBXTEPWW6EA5G&pd_rd_r=138ae756-baa5-4b60-8632-c877df877f25&pd_rd_wg=ay0Gv&ref_=nav_youraccount_switchacct&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=5b70f71a6ec74f1b2eb5f659cf6b5e1d&language=en_US) since I don't mind not being able to tilt to see the screen and it was so easy to get your phone in and out.

The [Chest Mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08B4WWRGP/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=4544c6f053d7b0f7926a6612be5e168f&language=en_US) is convenient because it requires no mount, but it has a lot of downsides: the videos are very bouncy, it's hard to aim the camera correctly, and you get really sweaty under the chest straps. We don't recommend it unless you truly can't use a mounted option.


# What features matter in a mount?

There's a few criterion we use to determine which mounts we like best. Not all of them will be relevant to everybody, so pick and choose what you care about most.

## How to strap in your phone
There are basically two flavors here: either you can clamp your phone in or you can strap it in.

Clamps are much faster to get your phone in and out: they have arms on the side that can screw in (like the [All-Metal Mount](https://www.amazon.com/GUB-Motorcycle-Aluminum-Rotation-Adjustable/dp/B07GKT8FBZ/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=WExxg&pf_rd_p=8b894231-4b84-44da-9446-c27cf0e8abc2&pf_rd_r=7S1SWGQFBXTEPWW6EA5G&pd_rd_r=138ae756-baa5-4b60-8632-c877df877f25&pd_rd_wg=ay0Gv&ref_=nav_youraccount_switchacct&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=5b70f71a6ec74f1b2eb5f659cf6b5e1d&language=en_US) above).
We like these, but they generally are not compatible with PopSockets (which we also love).

Straps take few seconds longer to strap in, and they can block the camera.
This is especially true for mounts where all four corners need to be strapped in.
Our [Recommended Mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079Z1CH9B/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=0d6c505ada2eb40ca9dfab1d2ce5417a&language=en_US) allows you to just strap in three corners, so the camera is unobstructed.

## How to secure it to your bike
If you live in a city with a lot of bike theft, you may not want a quick-release mount.
On the other hand, if you have several bikes that you want to move the mount between, you won't want to pull out your tools every time.

Our [Recommended Mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079Z1CH9B/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=0d6c505ada2eb40ca9dfab1d2ce5417a&language=en_US) is very easy to get on and off the bike, with no tools.
This works well in Pittsburgh, where there is not much bike theft (and especially not much bike accessory theft).
Plus, it's cheap enough that if it gets stolen it won't be as big of a deal as, say, your lights getting stolen.


## How sturdy is it?
We really like the [All-Metal Mount](https://www.amazon.com/GUB-Motorcycle-Aluminum-Rotation-Adjustable/dp/B07GKT8FBZ/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=WExxg&pf_rd_p=8b894231-4b84-44da-9446-c27cf0e8abc2&pf_rd_r=7S1SWGQFBXTEPWW6EA5G&pd_rd_r=138ae756-baa5-4b60-8632-c877df877f25&pd_rd_wg=ay0Gv&ref_=nav_youraccount_switchacct&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=5b70f71a6ec74f1b2eb5f659cf6b5e1d&language=en_US) for sturdiness. Consider it if you ride on rough roads (or even mountain biking?).
If you do go mountain biking, we'd love to see your footage - we haven't tried any of these on rough terrain.


# Mounts to avoid

We've tested a ton of mounts, some more than others. Here are some mounts we think you should avoid buying for the Dashcam App - though they may be great mounts in other settings.

## Do not buy #1: PopMount 2
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-PopMount-Ride-Scooter-Bicycle/dp/B08P4XJVPL/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&keywords=pop+mount+2+bike&qid=1633807572&sr=8-1&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=687a8bac46954f6a2c12754cb694a5f3&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08P4XJVPL&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B08P4XJVPL" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

We had this mount break on us - after several months of near-daily use, it snapped.
Looking at the damage, it looks like it was designed mostly with plastic with a thin metal screw - a design that would probably be fine if you used the mount for Google Maps, but isn't strong enough to support the phone as a dashcam.

If you do buy this mount, be aware that the strap blocks the camera.
One way to get around that problem is to pull the strap even further until you hang the phone on the secod hook, which gets you a video that [looks like this](https://twitter.com/DashcamBike/status/1448636353948880900?s=20).


## Do not buy #2: Camera-Blocking Mounts
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorcycle-Bicycle-Handlebar-Universal-Adjustable/dp/B098R19S3X/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=Motorcycle+Phone+Mount+Holder+Bike+Phone+Mount+Cell+Phone+Mount+Holder+for+Bike+Bicycle+Sport+Road+Bike+Handlebar+Universal+360+Adjustable+for+iPhone+12+11+xr+Pro+Max+All+Phones&qid=1636673275&qsid=131-2770754-2039666&sr=8-3&sres=B098R19S3X,B07M7TK3NJ,B01LWDCSIZ,B08R8MZYMH,B085DMV7XD,B08ZSPW3NF,B07GKT8FBZ,B089SHV1JH,B087CKZT2C,B01ICAI44S,B07PVMV49J,B08ZSNZ681,B075WPLYGM,B075WFRSVF,B015UIPMH2,B07S8G7NK1&srpt=PORTABLE_ELECTRONIC_DEVICE_MOUNT&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=5591e35fffbf1f669f0f50647862f62a&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B098R19S3X&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B098R19S3X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

There are several mounts with this design - all that we've tested block the third camera on an iPhone with 3 lenses.
It might be okay with a two-lens design, and we love how easy it is to get your phone in and out, but it wasn't worth the trade-off to us.
