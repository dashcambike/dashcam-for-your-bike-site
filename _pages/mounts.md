# The Best Phone Mounts for Dashcam for your Bike
Dashcam for your Bike is an iPhone App that makes recording footage on your bike easier.
With gesture-based controls so you don't have to take your eyes off the road, to screen-dimming to save you battery life, this app overcomes many of the issues people have with the normal camera app.

The app is compatible with any phone mount that doesn't block the camera. Here are our favorites.

# Our Top Pick

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08R93X4F6?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=li3&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=62f93bdc23fd843e23f3fea89f85b9c0&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08R93X4F6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US" ><br/>Buy on Amazon</a>

This mount has a ton of metal components which make it feel very sturdy.
It attaches at two corners, which reduces vibration in the dashcam footage.
The ball mount gives a wide range of rotation, so you can rotate down to avoid getting your handlebars in the shot, then tilt up to look at your Maps App.

There is a button in the back that locks the mount in place, which makes it hard to take out of the mount while riding. The button can get a little stiff in very cold weather, but it hasn't bothered us yet.

# What's important in a mount?

* **No Straps**: We no longer recommend mounts that you have to "strap" into your phone.  These make it hard to attach and detach your phone, and they often block the camera.
* **Easy Installation**: All our mounts are easy to install. Some require no tools, others require just a hex key.
* **Doesn't block camera**: The app always records with the widest-angle lens you have, so make sure the mount doesn't block that camera.

## Alternative #1: A Quicker-Release Mount

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/visnfa-Adjustable-Universal-Accessories-Smartphones/dp/B08TWMZFR8?pd_rd_w=kzQ1l&pf_rd_p=eb19c5b7-e15e-4646-8a38-bda700402de6&pf_rd_r=6EYMBHBWZVW24GQWWEYY&pd_rd_r=5118b3e4-0d36-416a-8c41-8a02c7c0418a&pd_rd_wg=iuvZV&pd_rd_i=B08TWMZFR8&th=1&linkCode=li3&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=707783e7e947601bf7035bff7f744920&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08TWMZFR8&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US" ><br/>Buy on Amazon</a>

This mount has slightly more limited motion than our top pick, but in exchange it's faster to get your phone in and out of the mount - meaning you can easily remove the phone while riding.

It can easily rotate to be horizontal and vertical, and installs quickly which makes it easy to move it between bikes.

The biggest downside is that your footage is more likely to have obstructions from your handlebars with this mount, and doesn't work well in landscape (horizontal) mode since too much of the handlebars will obstruct the camera.


## Alternative #2: All-Metal Mount
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/GUB-Motorcycle-Aluminum-Rotation-Adjustable/dp/B07GKT8FBZ/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=WExxg&pf_rd_p=8b894231-4b84-44da-9446-c27cf0e8abc2&pf_rd_r=7S1SWGQFBXTEPWW6EA5G&pd_rd_r=138ae756-baa5-4b60-8632-c877df877f25&pd_rd_wg=ay0Gv&ref_=nav_youraccount_switchacct&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=5b70f71a6ec74f1b2eb5f659cf6b5e1d&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07GKT8FBZ&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US" ><br/>Buy on Amazon</a>

While none of these mounts have broken on us, we have used a plastic mount that broke in the past.
If you're afraid of plastic components, consider this All-Metal Mount.
The downside: **this mount does not swivel**, meaning you cannot tilt it to view Google Maps.

## A note on PopSockets
All of these mounts are compatible with Swappable PopSockets - but you will need to remove the PopSocket for your phone to fit.
You can buy a <a href="https://amzn.to/3q7fG7D">Swappable PopSocket on Amazon</a> for $10 to $15.

# Mounts to avoid

We've tested a ton of mounts, some more than others. Here are some mounts we think you should avoid buying for the Dashcam App - though they may be great mounts in other settings.

## Do not buy #1: PopMount 2
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-PopMount-Ride-Scooter-Bicycle/dp/B08P4XJVPL/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&keywords=pop+mount+2+bike&qid=1633807572&sr=8-1&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=687a8bac46954f6a2c12754cb694a5f3&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B08P4XJVPL&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US" ></a>

We had this mount break on us - after several months of near-daily use, it snapped.
Looking at the damage, it looks like it was designed mostly with plastic with a thin metal screw - a design that would probably be fine if you used the mount for Google Maps, but isn't strong enough to support the phone as a dashcam.

If you do buy this mount, be aware that the strap blocks the camera.
One way to get around that problem is to pull the strap even further until you hang the phone on the secod hook, which gets you a video that [looks like this](https://twitter.com/DashcamBike/status/1448636353948880900?s=20).


## Do not buy #2: Camera-Blocking Mounts
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorcycle-Bicycle-Handlebar-Universal-Adjustable/dp/B098R19S3X/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=Motorcycle+Phone+Mount+Holder+Bike+Phone+Mount+Cell+Phone+Mount+Holder+for+Bike+Bicycle+Sport+Road+Bike+Handlebar+Universal+360+Adjustable+for+iPhone+12+11+xr+Pro+Max+All+Phones&qid=1636673275&qsid=131-2770754-2039666&sr=8-3&sres=B098R19S3X,B07M7TK3NJ,B01LWDCSIZ,B08R8MZYMH,B085DMV7XD,B08ZSPW3NF,B07GKT8FBZ,B089SHV1JH,B087CKZT2C,B01ICAI44S,B07PVMV49J,B08ZSNZ681,B075WPLYGM,B075WFRSVF,B015UIPMH2,B07S8G7NK1&srpt=PORTABLE_ELECTRONIC_DEVICE_MOUNT&linkCode=li2&tag=robotarmin0c-20&linkId=5591e35fffbf1f669f0f50647862f62a&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B098R19S3X&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=robotarmin0c-20&language=en_US" ></a>

There are several mounts with this design - all that we've tested block the third camera on an iPhone with 3 lenses.
It might be okay with a two-lens design, and we love how easy it is to get your phone in and out, but it wasn't worth the trade-off to us.
