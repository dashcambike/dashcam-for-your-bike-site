# Our Footage-Stabilizing Phone Mount
Our phone mount is designed to create the best footage and support the widest range of phones without blocking the camera.

## Stabilization Demo: Our Mount vs others

Our mount clamps both the top and bottom of the phone and has three vibration-dampening pads to keep your footage as shake-free as possible.


# Alternatives
If your phone is larger than 7" or your phone case is thicker than 0.5", you may need a different mount.
Here's what to look for:

* **No Straps**: Straps make it hard to attach and detach your phone, and they often block the camera.
* **No Quick-Release**: Quick-release mounts come loose too frequently. We recommend mounts that attach securely with a hex key.
* **Doesn't block camera**: You know your phone best. Find a mount that doesn't block the standard or wide-angle camera.

## #1: Quick-Release Mount

This mount has slightly more limited motion than our top pick, but in exchange it's faster to get your phone in and out of the mount - meaning you can easily remove the phone while riding.

It can easily rotate to be horizontal and vertical, and installs quickly which makes it easy to move it between bikes.

The footage is shakier than our top pick, and the mount can sometimes slide on the handlebars, causing the phone to rotate and record the sky.

## #2: All-Metal Mount

</a>

If you're afraid of plastic components, consider this All-Metal Mount.
The downside: **this mount does not swivel**, meaning you cannot tilt it to view Google Maps.

Note that we've tested our recommended mounts for thousands of hours without issue, and ridden on both streets, gravel, and cobblestone with them.

## Using Swappable PopSockets
All mounts we recommend are compatible with Swappable PopSockets - but you will need to remove the PopSocket for your phone to fit.
You can buy a <a href="https://amzn.to/3q7fG7D">Swappable PopSocket on Amazon</a> for $10 to $15.

# Mounts to avoid

We've tested a ton of mounts, some more than others. Here are some mounts we think you should avoid buying for the dashcam.bike app - though they may be great mounts in other settings.

## Do not buy #1: PopMount 2

    <img class="amznLink" src="/assets/mounts/popsocket.jpg"  alt="PopSocket PopMount 2">
</a>

We had this mount break on us - after several months of near-daily use, it snapped.
Looking at the damage, it looks like it was designed mostly with plastic with a thin metal screw - a design that would probably be fine if you used the mount for Google Maps, but isn't strong enough to support the phone as a dashcam.

If you do buy this mount, be aware that the strap blocks the camera.
One way to get around that problem is to pull the strap even further until you hang the phone on the secod hook, which gets you a video that [looks like this](https://twitter.com/DashcamBike/status/1448636353948880900?s=20).

## Do not buy #2: Camera-Blocking Mounts

</a>

There are several mounts with this design - all that we've tested block the third camera on an iPhone with 3 lenses.
It might be okay with a two-lens design, and we love how easy it is to get your phone in and out, but it wasn't worth the trade-off to us.

# What is dashcam.bike?
dashcam.bike is an app that turns your smartphone into a dashcam.
The app has gesture-based controls so you don't have to take your eyes off the road, screen-dimming to save you battery life, direct-to-311 reporting in certain cities, and easy creation of compilation videos.
