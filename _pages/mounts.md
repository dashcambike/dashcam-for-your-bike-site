# Our Best Mount
Our phone mount has been tested for thousands of hours, and creates the most stable footage of any mount we've tried.
It is compatible with all phone cases under 0.5" thick, and works with removable PopSockets.

While Dashcam for your Bike is compatible with a wide range of mounts, our branded mount works better than anything else we've tested.
It's secure, easy to install, and has a wide tilt angle so you can easily tilt your phone up to glance at Maps, then back down to continue recording.

## What's important in a mount?

* **No Straps**: Straps make it hard to attach and detach your phone, and they often block the camera.
* **No Quick-Release**: Quick-release mounts come loose too frequently. We recommend mounts that attach securely with a hex key.
* **Doesn't block camera**: The app always records with the widest-angle lens you have, so make sure the mount doesn't block that camera.

## A note on PopSockets
All mounts we recommend are compatible with Swappable PopSockets - but you will need to remove the PopSocket for your phone to fit.
You can buy a <a href="https://amzn.to/3q7fG7D">Swappable PopSocket on Amazon</a> for $10 to $15.

# Alternatives
If the above mount doesn't work for your case, we have some alternatives.
We have tested each of these for around 100 hours, but we have not tested them as thoroughly as our Dashcam-branded mount.

## #1: Quick-Release Mount

</a>

This mount has slightly more limited motion than our top pick, but in exchange it's faster to get your phone in and out of the mount - meaning you can easily remove the phone while riding.

It can easily rotate to be horizontal and vertical, and installs quickly which makes it easy to move it between bikes.

The footage is shakier than our top pick, and the mount can sometimes slide on the handlebars, causing the phone to rotate and record the sky.

## #2: All-Metal Mount

</a>

If you're afraid of plastic components, consider this All-Metal Mount.
The downside: **this mount does not swivel**, meaning you cannot tilt it to view Google Maps.

Note that we've tested our recommended mounts for thousands of hours without issue, and ridden on both streets, gravel, and cobblestone with them.

# Mounts to avoid

We've tested a ton of mounts, some more than others. Here are some mounts we think you should avoid buying for the Dashcam App - though they may be great mounts in other settings.

## Do not buy #1: PopMount 2

</a>

We had this mount break on us - after several months of near-daily use, it snapped.
Looking at the damage, it looks like it was designed mostly with plastic with a thin metal screw - a design that would probably be fine if you used the mount for Google Maps, but isn't strong enough to support the phone as a dashcam.

If you do buy this mount, be aware that the strap blocks the camera.
One way to get around that problem is to pull the strap even further until you hang the phone on the secod hook, which gets you a video that [looks like this](https://twitter.com/DashcamBike/status/1448636353948880900?s=20).

## Do not buy #2: Camera-Blocking Mounts

    <img class="amznLink" src="/assets/mounts/camerablocking.jpg" alt="Mount that would block the camera">
</a>

There are several mounts with this design - all that we've tested block the third camera on an iPhone with 3 lenses.
It might be okay with a two-lens design, and we love how easy it is to get your phone in and out, but it wasn't worth the trade-off to us.

# What is Dashcam for your Bike?
Dashcam for your Bike is an app that turns your smartphone into a dashcam.
The app has gesture-based controls so you don't have to take your eyes off the road, screen-dimming to save you battery life, direct-to-311 reporting in certain cities, and easy creation of compilation videos.
